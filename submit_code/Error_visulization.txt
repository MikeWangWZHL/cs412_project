[CLS] I ' ve been going to DBL for a couple years now . Acrylic set here , gel mani there . . But , I have a confession . . . I recently made a rash decision to go to cheaper salon , last minute , on a Saturday . I knew I wasn ' t going to get an appointment at DBL and I was going out for a girls day and I ' m not sure what I was thinking . ANYWAYS . . . The place was disgusting and my gel manicure was mediocre at best . The only positive thing that came from this experience was the appreciation I have DBL . Dallas boasts sanitation and continuing education . It really shows when compared to a garbage salon like the one I went to . I haven ' t been in a salon like that in so long that I forgot that DBL was special . Get yourself on a wait - list or find yourself a referral and treat yo self to the cleanest

[CLS] We ordered an expensive set of Zwilling Henckels ( made in Spain & Germany ) 15 piece knife set online and chose to pick - up at the Ross Park Mall Store . I went to pick it up and there was no one at the desk for over 15 minutes . Then a kind associate offered to help and gave me the package . Upon coming home , we noticed that the package had been opened , used , returned with a missing item and one of the knifes was heavily used from another set made in China . To add insult to injury , the customer service reps at Macys . com were really awful . They read a script and apologized so easily , not for a moment acknowledging the lost time and asked that we return it to the store and deal with the representative there . They sold us a used , incomplete , returned , unsaleable item and then put us in a position to waste more time tomorrow going back to the store and explaining this all over again .

[CLS] I ate here last weekend with two of my male friends . We had a reservation for Saturday at 10pm . Tip # 1 : Don ' t make a reservation for 10pm in Vegas . I started the drinking day at 8am with a bloody mary , so by the time our dinner started I was beginning my 14th consecutive hour of drinking . I have the receipt next to me , so I ' m just going to walk through it item by item : 2 Miller Lite - $ 12 : I swear to God I had no memory of us ordering two Miller Lites until I read it on the receipt just now . Clearly , despite the incredibly high quality of this restaurant , their Miller Lites are less than memorable . 6 oyster , daily - $ 24 : I am responsible for ordering this completely unnecessary appetizer . None of us are even all that crazy about oysters , though I did enjoy them . 1 Glass Pinot Noir - $ 17 : One

[CLS] About four weeks ago , I brought my son ' s Jeep to ATS with an A / C problem for a second opinion . The A / C in this vehicle had been completely replaced 2 1 / 2 years ago . Prior to ATS , I brought the vehicle to Ted Wiens Firestone on S . Eastern Ave . They quoted me nearly $ 1100 . 00 for the repair . I told Ted Wiens , that the system was only 2 1 / 2 years old . They gave me some double talk and I said I am not putting any kind of money like that into the vehicle and I was going to pick it up . They charged me $ 120 . 00 to check and charge the system , that did nothing . Back to ATS , I spoke to the Service Mgr Danny and told him what happened . Two hours later , and $ 70 . 00 , my A / C was blowing ice cold air and he basically said they misdiagnosed the problem at Ted Wien

[CLS] Hundreds of years ago , in the land that is now Pittsburgh , lived an Indian tribe . They lived their lives somewhat differently than other American Indians . This vegan people grew shaggy hair , wore tight leggings and V - neck shirts that were Not made from animal skin . In their spare time they worked on creating ironic pieces of art and rode on animals that only emitted half the CO2 of other animals . And the god they worshipped was not the rain god or the sun god or the wind god . No those were Far to mainstream . They worshipped the God of the Squirrel . And the sacred worshipping spot for this Squirrel God was , of course , on a hill that is now known as Squirrel Hill . Just kidding . None of that actually happened . It was just the first logical explanation I could come up with for why Squirrel Hill is called Squirrel Hill . Probably the real reason is something really boring . Like Sir William Pittsburgh ,

We booked using a third - party website that specified two double beds , and when we got here , all they had was a room with a king . I get it that those things aren ' t guaranteed .

[CLS] So when you go to a restaurant like this please expect a bit of a drawn out dinner , I think it was two and a half hours for our large party . Many said it was the best food they had in their life , and it was really wonderful . I will say that the appetizers had far more imagination than the main course which was a bit deflating . We went after a long day at a convection and most of us were tired and slightly delirious so the service being a tad slow made the dinner feel very much like The Cook , The Thief , His Wife and Her Lover . They do the thing where they set all the plates at once and the glasses never went empty and the wine list is to die for , they had a 15000 dessert wine that dated before the Titanic . One star is really for the main course not living up the expectations set previously .

Check out what you are entitled to on the Insurance Bureau of Canada ' s web site . Do not believe everything told to you . Check out things first .

After I drove home from the first repair , which was my air conditioning , I noticed that only one of the settings worked . When I told them about this , they informed me that they forgot to look at another part that was causing part of the issue with the air . They only charged me for the part when I came to get the ball joints fixed . The total bill to complete the air conditioning fix and the ball joints was $ 250

I got to my pedicure appt and began to chow down ( I am on my lunch break , hence the multi - tasking ) I noticed after one or two bites my chicken didn ' t taste right . So disappointed because I have minimal time , I called them back just to give them a heads up about their chicken and potentially save someone else from food poisoning . . . The gentlemen told me how they prep the chicken so it couldn ' t be it that it was under cooked . He went on to look up the order , provided me a full refund me and asked what I would like instead . I told him , one slice of pizza would suffice . Instead , he assured me he would fill my To - go order with food to equate to what I originally spent

Marshall wanted the spelling of my uncle ' s name and said that he would get the paperwork . When I came in that weekend , Marshall was no where to be found .

Apart from submitting the required paperwork to obtain official certification as a real ID which will add a nifty gold star symbol to your driver ' s license , one of the unavoidable times that you have to physically appear at the DMV is once every 8 years to take a vision test for license renewal . Such an examination is not required for the first renewal after 4 years which can be handled online or by mail . If you ' re on the ball , you can avoid a lengthy wait in line by first scheduling an appointment online to expeditiously process such matters at the DMV . I did this successfully two years ago and simultaneously took care of both my needed vision test and optional real ID upgrade in less than one hour at the DMV . If

We discovered that the salt had formed a solid brick in the tank and wasn ' t working properly . We had two separate companies come out to give us an evaluation . The first company said we needed to replace the entire tank , some valves , and the whole electronic component to the system ( I didn ' t know much but it the electronic part seemed to be working just fine ) . So the second company came out ( they are the ones stationed at Costco and swear they are reputable because they have the Costco backing ) . Well , they were worse . They came out and suggested that there were sooo many repairs that we should just replace the whole system with them for over $ 2500 . Then finally , we had an epiphany and called the sticker on the unit . In

Then I called the main number and they told me that the one on Bell had only a 20 minute wait and she could put my name in now . I said " go for it " and headed out . When I got there I was greeted by a nice lady behind a desk . I filled out the traditional paperwork and paid my co - pay and 3 minutes later I was being taken to the back . After a quick pre - checkup I was taken to another room where I was told the doctor would be right in . About 5 minutes later the doctor enters , she shakes my hand and asks me what ' s wrong . I tell her and she immediately apologizes for me feeling so badly and starts to look me over . After figuring out that I had a really bad ear infection she again apologizes because " that must really hurt "

We arrived this evening around 6 : 55 , no seats in the dining room so we headed outside . There was going to be 8 of us dining so it seemed like a logical solution . Upon arrival we were greeted and she took our drink order while we waited for our other family to arrive . After ordering garlic knots to snack on we ordered our dinner . After waiting a LONG time ( like 45 minutes ) we see the waitress approaching to tell us that they dropped our pizza on the floor and it would be another 15 minutes .

About 5 months ago , I realized I absolutely hated my job ( took a while ) and was unhappy every day when I woke up , dreading the day ahead . Wait a minute ! I came out here to deal ! So off to the internet , to see what dealing schools were out there . I went to a couple of the schools . The first was eh ! The second one I walked into , I instantly felt uncomfortable . No one approached me . All I saw were students standing around not looking too happy , most not dealing , not playing , with just a couple of teachers . I turned around and left . Third on my list was CEG Dealer School . Whoever said the third time ' s a charm wasn ' t kidding ! Students looked up and smiled at me as I walked in the door . One girl waved from

I read the reviews in both the Post - Gazette and the Tribune - Review the following day and I ' m kinda leaning towards what the P - G had to say . They said " At this point Eric Clapton doesn ' t have a thing to prove to anyone . " Indeed the problem is when you ' ve been performing for 40 + years , how do you decide which songs you ' re going to perform ? The paper wondered at first whether or not he would phone it in . Indeed , Clapton ' s set was strangely subdued at first . He led off with " Going Down Slow " and " Key to the Highway . " His set also seemed

[CLS] It ' s St . Patricks Day 2015 , and today I drove to Steve ' s Lunch when I got wind that the place was on fire . I had to identify the body of the Cleveland dining zone I grew to love more than anything on that demented strip of Lorain Rd . Legendary isn ' t the word for a place like Steve ' s Lunch . The interior color was a kind of yellow that can only be experienced and would be impossible to replicate . The items you could order were written on a dry erase board so faded that it was hard to read . It wasn ' t like the writing was smudged or anything like that , but the cold , stale breath of Father Time had weathered the writing on it . Father Time is indeed undefeated , and he sure was hard on Steve ' s Lunch . The specials were written on bizarre neon paper with sharpie markers and randomly taped to different parts of the wall . Last time I was in there

[CLS] I guess around early 2014 I noticed Dennis had left for greener pastures after 20 + years with the local fixture . All my subsequent visits were handled by an increasingly younger staff that didn ' t know crap about the products they were selling . Was very sad to see Dennis go after frequenting the store for over a decade . Apparently the store is either closing or being reset by DoItBest corporate , but who am I to say ? I only know I miss Dennis , his daughter , and their attention to the needs of customers .

[CLS] Let me begin by saying that I have used Yelp for guidance for many years . I ' ve heard the skepticism re . businesses " buying " only the positive reviews . The now absence of multiple negative reviews for Copperstate are indicative of this . Based on the plethora of reviews that reported the same shady , unethical acts of Copperstate I experienced , being gone , it ' s a safe assumption that the positive reviews are not legit . I ' d looked on Yelp for reviews when deciding to hire a contractor to deal with my flood damage . This was a time sensitive issue and I needed to move quickly . My Father called me at work and encouraged me to hurry home to meet Cory . I was under an insane amount of stress from my mom ' s cancer diagnosis and other personal matters , but Cory put me at ease . Perhaps a little too at ease .

A couple months back , I had scheduled an appointment to have my hair done with the Promenade location for my brother ' s wedding . I called a week in advance and was assured of my reservation . I showed up on the morning at the Promenade and somehow they had scheduled my appointment under another person ' s name and the receptionist made no attempts to help rectify the problem . Obviously I was upset and I even had to ask the man at the counter for phone numbers to other locations . He didn ' t even offer to help find an opening elsewhere . The first place I called was Desert Ridge Ulta and the receptionist immediately sensed my frustration and offered to get me in to have my hair done . I drove to Desert Ridge and when I walked in the door , the staff recognized I was that caller and they set right out to have me ready to go .

I figured I did not want to touch my hair for a while from all that bleach but I just could not stand my hair so I went to ulta and bought brown hair dye and dyed it myself at home . My coworkers commented on how it looks so much better than before and to their surprise I told them I just dyed it myself .

[CLS] I ' ll start off by saying that I ' m completely biased toward Handel ' s . I ' m from Youngstown , Ohio where this ice cream chain originated not 10 - 20 years ago , but 70 years ago . Because I ' ve been eating this ice cream since the 80s , this ice cream is my standard and what I use to compare everything else . As far as their service procedure , one person is at the window and he / she takes your order , makes it , and cashes you out . Everything is made when ordered , including hand packing the pints and quarts . There are no seating areas aside from a few benches . This is the way it ' s done at the original Handel ' s on Market and Midlothian in which you go and wait at least 15 - 20 minutes in line and you eat ice cream inside or outside your car . Should they continue this procedure like it ' s 1945 ? Absolutely not and hopefully they ' ll make some changes .

At the end , the waiter brought us our check ( we waited longer it felt for the check then it did for us to eat our meal ) he explained with the voucher how mich our meal wouldve been and how much it was ( free + our upgrade ) and how much we should tip based off howuch the check would have been . Ok great . We had our xash together as we had waited awhile to pay . Instead of letting him walk away , my boyfriend put the cash into the check thing and the waiter opened it up , counted our money and explained we did not tip enough based off his calculations . Excuse me

[CLS] The good : the sandwiches are decent ( though pretty much any NYC deli still makes better ) and you can customize heavily . Service is quick . The cons : manager during weekday lunches - a tall , bearded blond guy - yells constantly at an almost incredible volume . Currently in a near - deserted shop and he is still shouting at the top of his lung to communicate with staff . I ' m someone who likes going to loud bars but I have no idea why this would be necessary or appealing in anyone ' s mind . EDIT : Took off a star because of the response below . Perhaps this shop doesn ' t realize that most of its customers ( myself included ) are business people on lunch break who are looking to relax during our only downtime of the day - not for a high energy experience .

Blind Pig is a cute lounge / bar / cafe in a weird part of town ( too far from the strip for tourists , too out of the way for locals ) . It seems like a good chunk of their customers come from the high rise next door . Parking was not a problem when we went ( Sunday 7PM ) , however I can see it being a problem if they were busier . The Blind Pig is NOT in the high rise next door , don ' t accidentally drive into their lot ! You get a free cocktail / coffee / smoothie with Yelp check in ( Sorry , no beer ) . However , we were told that they were in the process of " changing their cocktail menu , " thus didn ' t have the ingredients to make any of the cocktails on the menu .

Looked around and the restaurant is now empty without any take out order then everything started to click and I know why .

She looked at them with a magnifying glass and told me they looked fine and sent me on my way . I was confused as to why they were not removed , so i checked the guidelines for dermatologists ( the physicians section ) about when a mole ( nevi ) should be checked for melanoma .

Electric company was replacing a transformer and had told them they should be back up soon . We went and killed some time and returned about an hour later and before going in hear a loud POP from where the electric truck was out front . Turned out the replacement transformer blew as it was being installed . The poor staff had people looking to check in , but no power to confirm reservations and the housecleaning crew was unable to clean rooms . They offered us one of the rooms they knew were cleaned , but the beds didn ' t work for our party . So we left to go to the Pirates game and got back to the hotel around midnight .

We don ' t like or respond well to high pressure sales tactics and prefer to be left alone , so when a salesman introduced himself as " Sam " we said hello , but continued on our way alone . Within a couple minutes he was back and my husband told him if we needed assistance that we would let him know . He continued to follow us - either physically or by keeping his eyes on us the entire time we walked through the store . I appreciate he likely works on commission and doesn ' t want to lose out on a sale , but he should really learn to back off a bit . We did a full circle of the store and realized that they did not have the style we were looking for . The store seemed smaller than the Cambridge location or perhaps they are just focusing on a different style . Anyway , before leaving I used the customer

The owner mentioned they found something in the jacket pocket , " maybe a business card or something , " and it was attached in a little stapled bag . To my surprise , it was ten bucks !

I did , at least , get a lot of cleaning done while waiting . Oh , I ' m still waiting and man is my house cleaning . Did I mention that I fear using the washroom incase the delivery finally arrives .

Suddenly I found myself staring at a Frank and Nancy Sinatra portrait while listening to hip - hop music . Obviously the restaurant manager had gone home and the youngsters had taken over .

[CLS] I have lived a lot of places and had a lot of post offices , and they ' ve all pretty much been awesome , or at least functional . I understand their job is not easy , and occasional mistakes happen . I have NEVER had constant issues with USPS until moving to Bloomfield and having the grave misfortune to deal with this godawful post office . Our postman constantly only delivers half of our packages , then will mark the rest so that they show " undeliverable - ready for pickup " when you check the tracking number . a ) They are NOT undeliverable ; one of us works from home and is there all day . He never knocks , not to mention he happily leaves * some * of our packages on the porch . b ) It ' s random which packages he chooses to leave ; none of our packages are delivery signature required . He just doesn ' t want to make more than one trip to the truck . Sometimes these are

It was hot . It was cheesy . It had marinara . Lol But BUT ! ! ! BUTTTTTTT ! ! ! Who the cuts pizza into small bite size pieces ? It ' s a " pizza PIE " ! ! ! I want pie shaped slices ! ! ! Who would think that you ' d have to say that . Or ask or that ? I mean . I get it for jumbo slices I guess . Like a 30 " pizza from San Diego giant pizza . . . But this is a 12 " . Cutting pizza this way disrupts the balance of flavors you get toward the crust . Now I have 4 pieces of pizza with no crust . And 4 pieces of crust that have no pizza .

I estimated our junk would fill an 8x10 ' trailer with four foot sides . They told me to except to pay between $ 200 and $ 300 .

They continued to provide me with ETA adjustments until their arrival , about 45 minutes into their two hour appointment window . Upon arrival they looked over the junk I wanted removed and estimated $ 275 . They asked my permission to back their trunk onto the driveway . In less than two hours all the junk was loaded into their truck and they carried some large items from the backyard to the front for us to load in our vehicle . They swept the garage and added the debris to their truck . They raked the gravel smoothing an area that hold old outdoor storage bins alongside the house . Total bill , $

Took about a week to be completed even though I was told two weeks because they were swamped with work . Service was faster than expected ! Ordered a short 3 . 4 " barrel for my Walther P22 because I hate the 5 " barrel , looks awkward . Went to install the 3 . 4 " barrel and the gun wouldn ' t slide backwards . Brought the P22 into Marxman to see what was wrong . Paid $ 75 upfront and was told that they would either have to cut a new mounting pin on a lathe or try to find one . Called them the following week for a status update and they said it was ready . Picked up the gun and saw that the 5 " barrel mounting pin wasn ' t with the gun . I asked what work was done .

[CLS] Update to 5 star review left June 2018 : The term consumer fraud is the best that comes to mind at this time . We purchased LVP , and the installers informed us that a subfloor needed to be installed first . Express was awesome and got that done . After a few months of average wear ( 2 adults in the home ) , the seams of the subfloor began to cause the vinyl to bulge . We noticed when it was put down that the installer filled the joints but didn ' t level it off . We have lost count at how many people have come out to look at this issue , and after many emails and phone calls , we finally agreed to spend an additional $ 2000 to upgrade and have new flooring installed . I was assured that the new flooring would cover the imperfections . In addition , Express agreed to replace subfloor that had been damaged . We were assured this product was impervious to water ,

The definition of Customer Service is NOT giving in to a demanding jerk of a customer & giving them what they think they are entitled to . It is about being friendly & assistive .

[CLS] Fun fact , there are some locales in Toronto that I could swear are * cursed . * Not because of some horrible poltergeist or existential issue . No , it is simply because the locale is so poorly located / designed that almost everything that opens hardly gets past the 6 month mark before it goes out of business . For example , the locale on the northwest corner , west of Bathurst and Bloor . It went from a McDonald ' s , to being closed for ages , to a Chinese restaurant , to a Latin Bar , then to a Latin / Sports bar to another nameless Asian place to now a Japanese ( possibly Fusion ) place . There is also another place in Scarborough that has been 5 - 6 restaurants in about 6 years . So Aroma was one of those places .

The technician suspected water damage but want to see if there were any other issues . I was warned the diagnostic could take up to 24 hours but half an hour after dropping the phone off , I got a call saying the water damage was confirmed and would I authorize a $ 60 screen replacement . I agreed and was told it would take less than another half an hour . At pickup , I was told there was no warranty at all because of the water damage . It would have been nice to be told that over the phone before I authorized the repair . Other shops appear to give a new screen protector with screen replacements but this one doesn ' t .
